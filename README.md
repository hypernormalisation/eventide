# Included Resource Packs

No resource packs are currently available for BYG, Better End, Better Nether, Simpleplanes, or Waystones.

As such, we use the lowest resolution available Sphax VanillaDBCraft 32x textures for Minecraft and for Tech Reborn, such that they blend in well with the packaged 16x asset textures for the above listed mods, without a particularly noticeable gap in quality.

# Included Shader Packs

A benefit of running lower resolution textures is the possibility to use higher-quality shaders than might have been possible with 128x assets at the same frame-rate.

We package a variety of shader packs:
- BSL
- Chocapic 13
- projectLUMA
- SEUS-Renewed
- Sildurs Vibrant Shaders High/Extreme with Volumetric Lighting

While BSL and projectLUMA have reasonable performances and a pleasing appearance, they can result in brightnesss flickering of foliage and other detailed textures.

Chocapic 13's liberal use of fog effects makes it the uncontested best pack to use in the Nether and End.

In the overworld where distant objects can awkwardly "pop in" during loading, Sildurs shaders' use of depth of field may result in more attractive large-scale vistas.

Switching between shaders is relatively inexpensive, so see what works for you. The default is Chocapic 13.
