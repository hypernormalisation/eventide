## Mod list

### Quality of Life

The following mods are added to improve the everyday feel and friendliness of Minecraft.

Mod showing enhanced information on food and stamina restoration.

#### Here's What You're Looking At (HWYLA)
Mod showing you, well, what you're looking at! With so many mods adding blocks to the game, easily seeing the
information for the block you're currently targetting is very useful!

#### Mod Menu
Simple in-game menu showing you what mods are installed and running.

#### Roughly Enough Items (REI)
Again, with so many mods, recipes can become daunting. REI provides a searchable recipe dictionary in your inventory.

#### Xaero's Minimap/World Map
Minmap and world map that automatically records your surroundings. Press "M" in game for your map, "Y" for your minimap
settings (though the defaults are tweaked and sensible).

# Included Resource Packs

No resource packs are currently available for BYG, Better End, Better Nether, or Waystones.

As such, we use the lowest resolution available Sphax VanillaDBCraft 32x textures for 
Minecraft, Traverse, Applied Energistics 2, and for 
Tech Reborn, such that they blend in well with the packaged 16x asset textures for the above listed 
mods, without a particularly noticeable gap in quality.

# Included Shader Packs

A benefit of running lower resolution textures is the possibility to use higher-quality shaders than might have been possible with 128x assets at the same frame-rate.

We package a variety of shader packs:
- BSL - https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/
- Chocapic 13 - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders
- projectLUMA - https://dedelner.net/projectluma/
- SEUS-Renewed - https://www.sonicether.com/seus/
- Sildurs Vibrant Shaders High/Extreme with Volumetric Lighting - https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/

While BSL and projectLUMA both have a reasonable performance and a pleasing appearance, they can display brightnesss flickering in foliage and other detailed textures.

Chocapic 13's liberal use of fog effects makes it the uncontested best pack to use in the Nether and End.

In the overworld where distant objects can awkwardly "pop in" during loading, Sildurs shaders' use of depth of field may result in more attractive large-scale vistas.

Switching between shaders is relatively inexpensive, so see what works for you. The default is Chocapic 13.
